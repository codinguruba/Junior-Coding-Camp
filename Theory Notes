Variables in Python are containers that are useed to store data
To declare a variable in python simply write its name

pokemon_name = "Pikachu"


Data Type
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
String  - Apple , Rajesh Hamal , Nepal
int - 0 , 44 , 18 ,20
float - 3.4 , 4.5 ,6.6

Comments in Python - Comments  can be used to explain Python code. Comment is not executed
Comments starts with  # 
Example of a comment
#This is comment and it doesn't get printed
print("Welcome to python")


Python Booleans
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

print(55==55)  - True
print(3>12) - False

Taking Input from User
# Problem
name = input("Enter your name:")
address = input("Enter your address:")
age = int(input("Enter your age:"))
print("The name you entered is",name)
print("The address you entered is",address)
print("The age you entered is",age)


Operator	Name	Example	Try it
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y


List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
mylist = ["apple","banana","mango","litchi"]

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "mango")

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function

for x in range(0,6):
   print("Helloworld")

Functions:
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

def function1():
  print("Helloworld from a function")

function1()
