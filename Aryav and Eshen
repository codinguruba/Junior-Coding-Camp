name = "Aryav Singh"
age = 10
print(name)
print(age)



Data Types
String - Apple , Banana , Rajesh Hamal    - It is enclosed in " ".
int - 10 , 12 , 5 , 8
float - 3.4 , 5.6 , 3.2


Taking Input from User
# Problem
name = input("Enter your name:")
address = input("Enter your address:")
age = int(input("Enter your age:"))
print("The name you entered is",name)
print("The address you entered is",address)
print("The age you entered is",age)


initial_speed = 10
initial_health = 10
name = input("Hello trainer what is your name?:")
print("Hello",name,"choose your pokemon")
pokemon_name = input("Enter your pokemon:")
print("Congratulations you choosed",pokemon_name)
print("\nPokemon Stats")
print("Pokemon Name:",pokemon_name)
print("Pokemon Health:",initial_health)
print("Pokemon Speed:",initial_speed)


Boolean Values
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

Example:
print(3==3)  -- True
print(3>2) --- True
print(2>3) -- False

== is used check equal to not

how if works - There is a condition in below program (pokemon_level>20) so if the condition is True . "your pokemon is strong you can evolve " will print.

pokemon_name = input("enter your pokemon:")
print("Congratulation you choosed ",pokemon_name)
pokemon_health = int(input("what is your pokemons health:"))
pokemon_speed = int(input("what is your pokemon speed:"))
pokemon_level = int(input("what is your pokemon level:"))
if(pokemon_level>20):
    print("your pokemon is strong you can evolve!")


15 May Program.
name = input("Hello what is your name:")
print("Hi",name ,"Lets get started")
pokemon_name = input("Choose your pokemon:")
print("Congratulation your pokemon is",pokemon_name)
choice = int(input("Enter your choice:"))

if(choice ==1):
    print(pokemon_name ,"Use tackle attack")

    
if(choice ==2):
    print(pokemon_name,"Use quick attack")

    
if(choice ==3):
    print(pokemon_name,"use thurderbolt...")


#Choice to add and multiply
number1 = int(input("Enter number 1:"))
number2 = int(input("Enter number 2:"))
choice = int(input("Press 1 for add / 2 for multiply:"))

if(choice == 1):
    add = number1+number2
    print(add)
    
if(choice ==2):
    multiply = number1*number2
    print(multiply)

#Important code
num1 = int(input("Enter a number:"))

if(num1>0):
    print("Positive number")
    
elif(num1 == 0):
    print("The number is 0")
    
else:
    print("The number is negative...")
    
print("Coding is so fun...")

# Code
number1 = int(input("Enter number1:"))
number2 = int(input("Enter number2:"))
choice = int(input("Press 1 for add , 2 for multiply , 3 subtract:"))

if(choice == 1):
