Boolean Values
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

== is used check equal to not

how if works - There is a condition in below program (pokemon_level>20) so if the condition is True . "your pokemon is strong you can evolve " will print.

pokemon_name = input("enter your pokemon:")
print("Congratulation you choosed ",pokemon_name)
pokemon_health = int(input("what is your pokemons health:"))
pokemon_speed = int(input("what is your pokemon speed:"))
pokemon_level = int(input("what is your pokemon level:"))
if(pokemon_level>20):
    print("your pokemon is strong you can evolve!")
